# Permissions and Groups Setup

This application uses Django's built-in permissions and groups to control access to specific actions.

## Permissions
The following custom permissions are defined in the `Book` model:
- `can_view`: Allows viewing books.
- `can_create`: Allows creating books.
- `can_edit`: Allows editing books.
- `can_delete`: Allows deleting books.

## Groups
The following groups are created and assigned permissions:
- **Viewers**: Can view books.
- **Editors**: Can view, create, and edit books.
- **Admins**: Can view, create, edit, and delete books.

## Enforcing Permissions
Permissions are enforced in views using the `@permission_required` decorator. For example:
- `@permission_required('advanced_features_and_security.can_edit')` ensures only users with the `can_edit` permission can access the view.

## Testing
1. Create test users and assign them to groups.
2. Log in as each user and verify that permissions are enforced correctly.


# Security Best Practices

This application implements the following security measures:

## Secure Settings
- `DEBUG` is set to `False` in production.
- `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER`, `X_FRAME_OPTIONS`, and `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF` are enabled to prevent XSS and clickjacking attacks.
- `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` and `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` are set to `True` to enforce HTTPS for cookies.
- `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` is enabled to redirect all non-HTTPS requests to HTTPS.
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is configured with a max-age of 1 year, including subdomains and preloading.

## CSRF Protection
All forms include the `{% csrf_token %}` tag to protect against CSRF attacks.

## Secure Data Access
Views use Django's ORM to safely handle user input and prevent SQL injection.

## Content Security Policy (CSP)
A Content Security Policy is implemented using `django-csp` to restrict the sources of content loaded by the browser.

## Testing
1. Verify that all forms include CSRF tokens.
2. Test the application in a production-like environment with `DEBUG = False`.
3. Use tools like [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/) to check for security headers and vulnerabilities.
